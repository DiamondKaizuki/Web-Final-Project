The use of this app is quite streight forward<br>
After "booting" up the app by either going to the action page and getting the link or just click this one https://diamondkaizuki.github.io/Web-Final-Project<br>
Once you enter the page there are five sections you can input characters and numbers, three however are optional and are not required to be filled<br>
You first need the book's title, then the author, other than those everything else is optional and used to your own convinence<br>
Once you complete the form press sumit it will make a card recording it in the library section where you can also edit what chapter you are on or change the link to a 3rd party website
